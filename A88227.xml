         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is the ſaying of the Spirit of God, in the 12. Prov. 10. <hi>That a righteous man regardeth the life of his beaſt, but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruell.</hi> How far your actions, and carriages with me, that am more then a Beaſt, have been point-blanke contrary to the firſt part of that divine Sentence, but, conſonant to the concluſion of it; is very eaſie to demonſtrate with pen and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               </gap> view of the World; and as facill to your face, before any competent Iudges to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and prove: And this is the Theme I have choſen a little to inſiſt upon at this preſent time: but being reſolved, to be as conciſe as I can, I ſhall not now make any ample repetition of your harſh dealing with me at the firſt; <hi>in divourcing me by the law of our own Will from my Wife,</hi> and getting the Lords to make an order to bear you out in it after you had done it; and <hi>that I ſhould ſpeak with none of my friends, but in the preſence and hearing of my Keeper, &amp;c.</hi> Which cruell Order, meerly obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and got by your ſolicitation, the Reader may read in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. p. of <hi>Vox Plebis.</hi> Therefore, in regard that the Author of that Book hath pretty well diſcovered your cruell and illegall dealing with mee, at my firſt comming to the Tower, eſpecially in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:153457:2"/>the 45, 46, 47, 48, 49. pages thereof: And the Author of a late booke called <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal tyrannie diſcovered,</hi> in the 48, 49. pages, And my ſelfe hath pretty well laid it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the 16, 17, 18, 20. pages of my printed Relation before the Committee of the honourable houſe of Commons <hi>Novemb.</hi> 6. 1646. called <hi>An Anotomy of the Lords tyrannie,</hi> to which I refer the Reader, and in regard you are not aſhamed of your cruel and illegall carriages towards me, but perſevere in them (as though you would juſtifie one tyrannie, with backing it with continuall acts of tyrannie) I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore goe on as effectuall and punctuall as I can, more fully to anotamiſe you, and your unjuſt, illegall, cruell, and unrighteous dealing with me, and for matter of fact, ſhall lay nothing to your charge, but what I will juſtifie before any legall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the firſt place, I deſire to let you underſtand, <hi>that I am a free-born Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and have lived a legall man thereof all my dayes, being never yet convicted of any attempt or deſign undertaken, or countenanced by me, that did tend to the ſubverſion of the Fundamentall Lawes and conſtitution thereof;</hi> but have alwayes ſided with the Parliament it ſelfe, who hath pretended nothing ſo much, <hi>as the preſervation of the lawes liberties, and Fundamentall Freedomes of</hi> England, <hi>and the peace and tranquility of the people;</hi> as you may read in their owne Declarations, 1 <hi>part col. Dec. pag.</hi> 172. 195. 214. 281. 342. 464. 498. 663. 666. 673. 750. for the preſervation of which, I have conſtantly, couragiouſly, and as freely adventured my life, as any of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, what ever he be: And therefore in every particular, have juſt and grounded cauſe to expect the utmoſt priviledge and benefit that the Law of <hi>England</hi> will afford any man whatever, that is under the obedience and ſubjection thereof: Nay more over, having to doe with thoſe men as my Iudges, that made all or the moſt of theſe Declarations, and who have alſo declared, <hi>it lyes not in their power to inſlave or invaſalize, the people,</hi> being truſted for their good, not for their miſchiefe, to provide for their weal, but not for their woe, 1 part Col. dec pag. 150. 214, 266. 267. 494. 497. 636. 659. 660. 694. 696. and who in theſe and other of their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, <hi>imprecate and pray that the wrath and vengeance of Heaven and Earth may fall upon them, and theirs, when they ceaſe actually to performe what verbally they there declare,</hi> unto whtch I ſay AMEN: And there they proteſt, vow, and ſweare, <hi>they will maintain the fundamentall Lawes, and Liberties of the people,</hi> and therefore in that reſpect, you cannot groundedly, in the leaſt, thinke, that I ſhould <hi>Iſſacar</hi>-like ſtoop willingly unto any other buthens, impoſitions, or commands layd upon mee by you, or any other whatſoever, <hi>that are not warrantable and juſtifiable by the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Lawes of the Land,</hi> and whether your practiſes have been ſo with me, I-will compare them to the Law, and leave every rationall man to judge.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I doe not find any Law that makes priſons, places of executions, puniſhment, or torment, but only places of ſafe cuſtody, for the Law of <hi>England</hi> (as Sir <hi>Edward Cooke</hi> in the ſecond part of his inſtitutes fol. 28. excellently declares) is a Law of mercy, (yet as he then ſaid, ſo I much more ſay now) <hi>it is now turned into a meere ſhaddow, which is the moſt we now enjoy of it</hi>) and therefore as the Author of the late booke, called <hi>Liberty vindicated againſt Slavery,</hi> very well ſaith, p. 7. from Sir <hi>Edward Cooke</hi> in the 1. part of his inſtit. f. 260. <hi>that by the Law, priſons are ordained not for diſtruction, but for ſecuring of mens perſons, untill they be brought forth unto due and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:153457:2"/>ſpeedy tryall (for being in priſon, they are under the moſt eſpeciall protection of the Law, and the moſt tender care thereof)</hi> and are therefore to be humanly, courteouſly, and in all Civillity, ordered and uſed; otherwiſe Goalers are not keepers, but tormentors and executioners of men untryed, and uncondemned, <hi>but this were not</hi> (ſalvo cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia) <hi>to keep men in ſafety,</hi> which the Law implyes <hi>(and is all it requires)</hi> but (diſeruere) <hi>to diſtroy before the time,</hi> which the Law abhors and deteſts, yea and that priſoners (though never ſo notorious in their crimes) may be the more honeſtly and carefully provided for, and the better and more civilly uſed, and to the end, that Goalers and Keepers of priſons, ſhould not have any colour or excuſe, for exacting any thing from priſoners, <hi>(under what colour or pretence ſoever, whether the ſame be called fees, or Chamber-rent)</hi> who are in cuſtody of the Law: It is provided, and declared by the Law, <hi>that all priſons and Goales what ever, be the Kings, for the publike good, and therefore are to be</hi> repared and furniſhed as priſons at the common Charge, ſee Cook on the 1. E. 2. <hi>Satutum de frangent bus priſonum,</hi> in his ſecond part inſtitutes fol. 589 and on the 26. Chap. of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> fol. 74. <hi>Ibim, and on the ſtatute of Weſtminſter.</hi>

            <p>Yea, and the Law takes care that in caſe the priſoner when he is in priſon, have no meanes of his owne to live upon, that then by the <hi>publike he is to be maintained,</hi> 14. Eliz. 5.21. Iames 28. Vox Plebis, pag. 57. for a freeman of England (as I am) <q>is not brought to priſon to be ſtarved with cold, or hunger, but to the end juſtice upon him may be done: The priſon, at moſt, in Law, is but a ſafe preſerver but not a deſtroyer of the priſoner, who with all convenient ſpeed according to Law, is to come to his tryall, and either according unto Law to be condemned, or elſe to be delivered in convenient time without delay, 4 E. 3.2. See my anſwer to Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> called <hi>Innocency and Truth juſtified,</hi> pag. 32. who by the Law is never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in priſon above 6. moneths at moſt, for Goale deliveries are by the 4. E. 3.2. to be kept and made three times a yeare, which is once in foure moneths, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if need ſhall be.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And as the Author of <hi>Vox Plebis</hi> pag 55. ſaith, out of Stamf. pl. Cor. f. 30. <q>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment by Law, is (neither ought to be) no more then a bare reſtraint of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, without thoſe illegall diſtinctions, of cloſe and open impriſonment, and therefore <hi>Bracton</hi> fo. 18. ſaith, that if a Goaler keep his priſoner more cloſe then of right he ought, whereof the priſoner dieth, this is fellony in the Goaler.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Horne,</hi> in the mirrour of Iuſtice. pag. 288. ſaith <q>that it is an abuſion of the Law that priſoners are put into Irons, or other paine, before they are attainted. And pag. 34. 36. he reckons the ſterving of priſoners by famine, to be among the crimes of homicide in a Goaler.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And we find in the 3. E. 3. Fitz. H. Tit. pl. Cor. 295. <q>that it was fellony at Common Law, in Goalers to compell their priſoners by hard impriſonment to be. come approvers, whereby to get their goods: which Law is ſince confirmed by the ſtatute of 14. E. 3. Chap. 10. with ſome inlargement; as to under keepers of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and the penalty of the Law, and that Goalers having done this, have beene hanged for it, you may read 3. E. 3.8. Northampton, Fitzh. pl. Cor. 295. and elſe where, but this for a raſt to them.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:153457:3"/>
            <p>In the ſecond place, I will tell you what the Law ſaith about Gaolers Fees. The mirrour of Iuſtice pag. 288. <hi>tells us, that it is an abuſion of the Law, that priſoners or others for them, pay any thing for their entries into the Goale, or for their going out; this is the Common Law;</hi> there is no ſee at all due to any Goalers whatſoever by the Common Law; <hi>See what the ſtatutes ſay.</hi> The ſtatute of Weſtminſter 1. Chap. 26. being the 3. E. 1.26. <hi>ſaith, that no Sheriffe, nor other the Kings Officer, take any reward to doe his Office, but ſhall be paid of that which they take of the King, and he that ſo doth ſhall yield twice as much, and ſhall be poliſhed at the Kings pleaſure,</hi> under which word Officer, is concluded Goaler, Coroner, &amp;c. ſo Sir <hi>Edward Cooke</hi> 2. part inſtitutes fol. 209. Stam. pl. Cor. 49. nay, by the ſtatute of 4. E. 3.10. Goalers are to receive theeves, and fellons, taking nothing by way of fees for the receipt of them, ſo odious is this extortion of Goalers, that very theeves and fellons are exempt from payment of fees. It is true, that by an incroaching ſtatute upon our liberties, made in the 23. H. 6.10. there is a fee given to the Goaler to be paid him by his priſoner, but yet it is very ſmall, the words of the ſtatures are theſe; <q>nor that any of the ſaid Officers and Miniſters, by occaſion or under colour of their Office, ſhall take any other thing by them, nor by any other perſon to their uſe, profit, or avaiſe of any perſon by them or any of them to be arreſted, or attached, nor of any other of them for the omitting of any arreſt, or attachment to be made by their body, or of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by them or any of them, by force or colour of their Office, arreſted or attached for fine, fee, ſuit of priſon, mainpriſe, letting to baile, or ſhewing any eaſe or favour to any ſuch perſon ſo arreſted, or to be arreſted for their reward or Profit, but ſuch as follow; that is to ſay, for the Sheriffe 20. <abbr>d.</abbr> the Bayliffe which maketh the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt or attachment 4 <abbr>d.</abbr> and the Gaoler, if the priſoner be committed to his ward, four pence; and that the Sheriffe, under-Sheriffe, Sheriffes, Clerke, Steward, or Baylife of Franchiſe, Servant or Bayliffe, or Coroner, ſhall not take any thing by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of his office by him nor by any other perſon to his uſe, of any perſon for the making of any return or panell, and for the copy of any panel, but 4. <abbr>d.</abbr>

            <p>And it followes in the ſame Statute, <q>that all Sheriffes, under-Sherffes, Clerks, Bayliffes, Goalers, Coroners, Stewards, Bayliffes of Franchiſes, or any other Officers or Miniſters, which doe contrary to this Ordinance in any point of the ſame, ſhall loſe to the party in this behalfe indammaged or grieved, his treble dammages, and ſhall forfeit the ſum of 40. <abbr>l.</abbr> at every time they or any of them doe the contrary thereof in any point of the ſame, where of the King ſhall have the one halfe to be imployed in the uſe of his houſe, and in no otherwiſe, and the party that ſhall ſue the other half.</q>

            <p>But (as Sir <hi>Edward Cooke</hi> well obſerves, on the 25. chap of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> 2. <hi>part Inſtitut. fol.</hi> 74.) <hi>after the rule of the Common Law was altered, and that the Sheriffe Coroner, Goaler, and other the Kings Miniſters, might in ſome caſe take of the ſubiect; it is not credible what extortions and oppreſſions have hereupon enſued. So dangerous a thing it is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to ſhake or alter any of the Rules or Fundamentall points of the Common Law, which in truth are the main Pillors and Supportars of the Fabrick of the Common-wealth,</hi> as elſe-where I have noted more at large <hi>viz. fol.</hi> 51, 210.249. <hi>Ibim.</hi> ſee the Preface to the 4. part of his Reports, and the 4. part of his inſtitutes capof the High Court of Parliament, f. 41.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:153457:3"/>
            <p>Now Sir, having laid this ſure foundation, I will aſſume the boldneſſe, to com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pare your dealings with me, to the fore-mentioned rules that the Law preſcribe you: And firſt to the matter of uſage, you know very well, you of your owne head at firſt kept my wife from me, and made me a cloſe priſoner, as in the fore-mentioned bookes, pag. 2. is truly declared.</p>
            <p>And then ſecondly, although you could not but know that by the Lords, &amp;c. in the Star-Chamber, I, for about foure yeares together before this Parliament, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-went a great diſtruction by them, both in my body, goods, and trade: and fince this Parliament, have ſpent many hundred pounds to obtaine my juſt repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (beſides other great loſſes I have had) and yet have not got a penny, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a younger brother, and in Land have not 6. <abbr>d.</abbr> in comming in the year; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing robbed of my trade, calling, and lively-hood, by the Merchant Monopolizers: ſo that I could not with freedome tranſport one Cloth into the Low-countries, to get any lively-hood thereby: all which, above a yeare agoe, I was neceſſitated pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to declare, in anſwer to <hi>William Pryns</hi> lyes and falſhoods, in my book called <hi>Innocency and Truth juſtified,</hi> which there you may read, eſpecially in pag. 39. 43. 47. 48. 62. 65. 75. and now being committed to your cuſtody in the Tower, the chargeableſt Priſon this day in all <hi>England,</hi> and where <hi>I</hi> am denyed the juſt and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal uſage and allowance that the King himſelfe uſed to allow all priſoners committed to this place, although they had great eſtates of their owne, in their owne hands and poſſeſſion, whoſe allowance was to find them diet, lodging, and pay their fees, <hi>Vox Plebis, p.</hi> 50. 56. 57.</p>
            <p>Nay, when I came in, and deſired you, that I might have my diet from my wife out of the town, which I did for two reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for ſafety, having heard much of ſir <hi>Thomas Overburies</hi> being poyſoned when he was a priſoner in the Tower.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the ſaving of money, which ſtood me much upon; but you abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denyed me that legal and juſt priviledge, and tyed me either to faſt, or have my diet from the Cookes in the Tower.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, being thus committed to this extraordinary chargeable expenſive place, and being in ſo mean a condition, as I muſt ingeniouſly confeſſe <hi>I</hi> was, you took in the third place, the ready way to ſterve and deſtroy me; and of your owne head, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered your Warders to take the names and places of habitation, of all thoſe that came to ſee me, or ſpeak with me, a diſtructive bug-bear to any captived priſoner, which the Law of <hi>England</hi> doth not in the leaſt authorize and inable you to doe: but this was not all, but in the fourth place, my friends, though they gave their names, were by your Warders, ſet on by your ſelfe (for upon your ſcore, <hi>I</hi> muſt, and doe lay it all) exceedingly in words abuſed, and divers of them turned away, and not ſuffered to come and ſpeake with me: <hi>O bloody and cruell man!</hi> what is this elſe, but an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Declaration of your reſolved intention, to deſtroy me in my impriſonment under your cuſtody? which the Law abhors: but if for the ſake of the Law, or for my ſake, you will not ſquare your dealings with me, according to the known law of the kingdome, then for your owne ſake, <hi>I</hi> deſire you to remember your Predeceſſour, Sir <hi>Garvaſe Elviſh,</hi> who was indicted by the name of Gaoler of the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and hanged upon Tower-hill, for conſenting to the poyſoning of his Priſoner, Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury, Vox Plebis,</hi> pag. 47.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:153457:4"/>
            <p>In the fifth place, ſeeing by all the fore-mentioned wayes and meanes you could not ſcare all my friends from me, and ſo by conſequence deſtroy me.</p>
            <p>Then you deviſe another way, and ſet one of your old Maſtive dogs upon me, to baite and to worry me with lyes, reproaches, and calumniations: and for that end, printed and publiſhed a moſt baſe and ſcandalous booke againſt me, thereby to make me odious to all men whatſoever, that would believe that book, which was publiſhed againſt me at ſuch a time; when by your ſelfe, my hands were faſt tyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind my back, being kept by your order very ſtrictly from Pen, Ink, and Paper, and ſo in a condition unable publikely to vindicate my ſelfe, and much importunity was <hi>I</hi> forced to uſe to your ſelfe, before <hi>I</hi> could obtaine leave from you to anſwer it, and neceſſitated to tye my, ſelfe by promiſe to ſuch and ſuch conditions: and amongſt the reſt, that you ſhould read it all over, before it was publiſhed: And <hi>I,</hi> for my part, performed my promiſe, and was neceſſitated to give the originall into your hands in ſuch haſt, that <hi>I</hi> could not take a Copy of it: out of whoſe hands, <hi>I</hi> could not get it, tell <hi>I</hi> was in ſome reſpect neceſſitated to an arbitration: and being not able to doe what <hi>I</hi> would for my own vindication. <hi>I</hi> was in a manner compelled by you to be content with what <hi>I</hi> could doe, which was to accept a ſubmiſſion from him for my wounded, rent, and torn reputation by him: although, if <hi>I</hi> could have accompliſhed what <hi>I</hi> deſired, I ſhould firſt have publiſhed my anſwer to his lyes: and then if he had a mind put it to arbitration, but neceſſity hath no other Law but a ſtooping to it: but <hi>I</hi> was in hope, that <hi>I</hi> ſhould have found ſo much cancor and ingenuity in you, &amp; your Agent old <hi>Iohn White,</hi> as that <hi>I</hi> ſhould not have had the like abuſes from you after that arbitration, that <hi>I</hi> had before it from you both; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that he at the gate, as my friends informes me, doth not ceaſe in his rancour and venim againſt me; I muſt be neceſſitated to publiſh my anſwer to him; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, ſeeing as <hi>I</hi> conceive, <hi>Tho. Edwards</hi> the cankered <hi>Gangraena,</hi> is joyned in confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy with him: But at the prefent, <hi>I</hi> ſhall content my ſelfe with the inſerting of his recantation, or acknowledgement, and referre the Reader for a full relation of that arbitration, to the 59. 60, 61, 62, 63. pages of my late book, called <hi>Londons Liberty in Chains diſcovered;</hi> the aforeſaid acknowledgement thus followeth:</p>

            <p>Sixthly, after all this, by meanes of my <hi>Wifes Petition,</hi> which was delivered to the Houſe of Commons 23. <hi>September</hi> 1646. and which you may read in the laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned book. pap. 65, 66., 67, 68 &amp;c. by meanes of which, there was a Committee of the honourable houſe of Commons appointed, to heare and receive my complaint againſt the Lords, and the 6. of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1646. was the laſt time <hi>I</hi> was before the Committee; where <hi>I</hi> had an opportunity, in part, to declare unto them, your ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall dealing with me: which Declaration, you may read in the 17, 18, 20. pages of that relation, now in print; and <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſſe unto you, I did thinke that you durſt not have run the hazzard of perſevering in your illegall dealings with me: but in regard you doe, it cleerly demonſtrates unto me, that you judge the ſtreames of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſo muddy and corrupted <hi>(by the intereſt and power of your Lords, and their facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who would have no other rule, but their own baſe and corrnpt wills to walke by, and therefore lay the rule of the Law and Juſtice aſide)</hi> that they will never run cleer, nor purely againe, to puniſh ſuch tranſgreſſors as you are.</p>
            <p>But that you may know (although I have had exceeding hard meaſure, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo long delayed in the making of my report) that I am not out of hopes, nor in deſpaire, I give you this freſh charge and tell you, that after I had done with the Committee, your next illegall deſigne that you executed upon me, was, that my friends could not paſſe your guard, unleſſe my keeper were there preſent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct them unto me; by meanes of which, ſome of them have beene forced to come four ſeverall times, before they could find him at the Gate; and others have beene forced to ſtay, and ſit in the guard an hour, and ſometimes two, expecting his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; without whoſe preſence, they could not have exceſſe to me; and divers of them in the time of their ſtay at the Guard, examined whether they be not Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, or no, and whether they never preached in Tubs, or no: And if they anſwer croſly to the queſtions, as well they may, then they are fallen upon, and both they and I in words exceedingly abuſed: and <hi>I</hi> am told, that an old tall man in black, with a great ſtaffe in his hand, is not wanting to play his part, which I judge to be Mr <hi>White.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſir, is not this the height of illegality, cruelty, tyrannie, and bloud-thirſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in you, thus to deale with me; indevouring thereby ſtrongly to ſcare away all
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:153457:5"/>my friends from me? For, who in ſo many difficulties and abuſes would come to viſit a man, unleſſe he bore a very great affections to him? the which, if he doe, the continual meeting with theſe baſe and unwarantable affronts, in concluſion will make him wery.</p>
            <p>And truly ſir, let me tell you, <hi>this is not to uſe me with civility, and humanity in my impriſonment,</hi> as the Law requires I ſhould, but this is to torment, puniſh, and deſtroy me, which, the Law, and all juſt and honeſt men abhors and deteſts.</p>
            <p>In the 8. place, being in the condition that <hi>I</hi> am in, and being guilty of no legall crime in this world; unleſſe it be for being over honeſt and zealous for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the juſt and publique Liberties of the Kingdome; <hi>I</hi> know no reaſon, why I may not enjoy the utmoſt priviledge and liberty in the Tower, that any priſoner in it doth enjoy: yet notwithſtanding, not many weeks agoe, <hi>I</hi> was but going with a fellow-priſoner in the path that leads to the Record office; and comming back to my Lodging under the Gate, that is juſt againſt the Traytors Gate, I met your pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gentleman Goaler, and immediatly Mr. <hi>Comport,</hi> my Landlord and Keeper came and delivered a meſſage from you to me, which was to this effect: <hi>That Mr. Leiutenant did underſtand, that I was beyond the Ring: but it was his pleaſure, that J ſhould forbeare to goe any more beyond it:</hi> Vnto which, <hi>I</hi> replyed, Landlord, <hi>I</hi> had only thought, that to goe beyond the Ring, had beene for a man when he came to it, to have turned on the right hand, and ſo to have gone, as if he would have gone out of the Gate, which <hi>I</hi> did not in the leaſt: for <hi>I</hi> turned on the left hand with one of my fellow-priſoners, and walked in the path that goes to his Chamber, and divers other Chambers of my fellow-priſoners, which path they doe and may walke in every day in the week, and every hour in the day. And therefore, tell your Maſter from me, <hi>I ſhall not obey his order, for I have as good right to enioy any privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge within the Tower, as any priſoner in it: and therefore will walk that way againe, ſeeing all my fellow-priſoners inioy the ſame liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 9. place, the other night there being a friend with me, about 6. or 7 a clock at night, <hi>I</hi> walked out of my chamber with him; which is a priviledge that all my fellow-priſoners enjoy, and he having a candle and lanthorn in his hand, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing under Cole Harbour Gate, <hi>I</hi> was roughly and ſuddenly demanded whether <hi>I</hi> went? And <hi>I</hi> replyed, along with my friend, to conduct him as farre as my liberty would extend (which was down to the Ring, which is as <hi>I</hi> conceive, at leaſt three or foure ſcore yards on this ſide of the gate where your guard ſtands) and <hi>I</hi> was reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto in theſe words, <hi>Sir, you ſhall not goe:</hi> At which, looking well about me (it being very dark) to ſee who it was, that was ſo malipart, <hi>I</hi> perceived it to be your ſelfe (who had with you, as <hi>I</hi> conceived ſome of your Warders) unto which <hi>I</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Truly ſir, <hi>I</hi> doe not like the word <hi>ſhall;</hi> it is but unhanſome language, to tell me, <hi>I</hi> ſhall not go.</p>
            <p>No ſir <hi>I</hi> ſay (ſaid you) you ſhall not goe; for you ought not to ſtir out of your chamber after candles are lighted.</p>
            <p>Truly ſir (ſaid <hi>I</hi>) <hi>I</hi> know no ſuch order. Vnto which, you replyed, Well, then ſir, I now give you ſuch an order: and <hi>I</hi> bid you give it to thoſe that would obey it; for <hi>I</hi> would not: and <hi>I</hi> gave you the reaſon of it; which was, that <hi>I</hi> was a free-borne Engliſh-man, a Kingdome that pretends (at leaſt) to be governed by Law, and not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:153457:5"/>by Will, and I am not to be ſubject unto thoſe orders in my impriſonment, that have no other Warrant, but the Gaolers Will. Neither will I willingly be ſubject in the Tower unto any other orders but what are conſonant and agreeable to the fundamentall Laws of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Unto which you replyed; Sir, you ſhall obey my orders, and I will make you.</p>
            <p>Sir, ſaid I, I will not obey your orders, nor you ſhall not make me: And <hi>I</hi> tell you to your face, I ſcorn both you and your orders, and that I value you not, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of my naile.</p>
            <p>Unto which, you replyed, Sir I will make you, for I will lock you faſtenough in your chamber: And <hi>I</hi> bid you doe your worſt, that either you could, or durſt doe, I cared not a ſtraw for you: But I bad you take notice of this, by the way; that if you locked me up by the power of your owne unbinding will, and did not make your docres very ſtrong, I would make work for your Carpencers, by breaking them into as many pieces as I could.</p>
            <p>You replyed, you would make them up againe. And I told you I would break them againe.</p>
            <p>You told me, your ordering us to keep our Chamders after candle was lighted was for your own ſecurity.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now take liberty, to return you a more full anſwer to this, then I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to you, which is this; That I for my part, for all the gold in <hi>London,</hi> would not give juſt cauſe to be counted ſo baſe and unworthy, to do upon deliberation that action, that I would not juſtifie to the death: But if I ſhould in the leaſt, ſtep afide, I ſhould contract unto my ſelfe that guilt, which I am confident, all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies I have in <hi>England,</hi> are not able in the leaſt to fixe upon me: For, I underſtand by the Law of this Kingdome, that he that is committed to priſon for Felony, or Treaſon; although really and truly he be guilty of neither, yet if he break priſon, and be taken again, he ſhall dye like a Fellon or Fraytor that is legally convicted, 1. <hi>E.</hi> 2. <hi>de frangentibus priſonam. See Cookes</hi> 2. <hi>part. instit. fol.</hi> 590. 591. For his flight, in the eye of the Law, argues guiltineſſe.</p>
            <p>And beſides, my friend and I had a horn Lanthorn and Candle, which put all out of ſuſpition of going out in the dark.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, what ground have you, upon any pretence whatever framed by your ſelfe, to lock me up in my chamber, as ſoon as candles are lighted, ſeeing I am in a moated and double walled Priſon, where you have not only a Train-band, but alſo great ſtore of your owne Warders to ſecure me?</p>
            <p>And therefore, I tell you plainly, I ſhall never condiſcend to be locked up ſooner then that convenient houre of 8. a clock, the accuſtomed hour of the place, which is much ſooner then they are in other priſons, that <hi>I</hi> have been in.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if under pretence of your ſecurity, <hi>I</hi> ſhould give way for you to confine or lock me up in my chamber, at candlelight, which then was before five a clock, may not you as well and as groundedly upon the ſame pretence (if you pleaſe to ſay it is for your ſecurity) keep me locked up in my chamber till 12. a clocke, yea, the whole day, if you pleaſe: And if I ſhould ſuffer this in the leaſt, what am I leſſe then traiterous to my ſelfe, and to my liberties, to give you a power by your own meer will, to make and impoſe a law upon me, whenſoever you ſhall pleaſe to ſay that its for your ſecurity? when the Law provides and enjoynes you nomore, but

            <p>Now ſir, in the laſt place, I come to acquaint you, what monies <hi>I</hi> have paid, ſince <hi>I</hi> came to the Tower for my Chamber-rent only; the 10. of <hi>July</hi> laſt <hi>I</hi> came hither and you ſent me to the Lodging where <hi>I</hi> am, with extraordinarie ſtrict and ſevere command upon my Keeper, who within certain dayes after <hi>I</hi> came to him, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded chamber-rent of me at a great deale higher rate then <hi>I</hi> pay, and <hi>I</hi> told him neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity had no law; and <hi>I</hi> therefore deſired him to ask me reaſonably, and he ſhould ſee what <hi>I</hi> would ſay to him: So at laſt, he asked me 15. <abbr>s.</abbr> a week. <hi>I</hi> told him <hi>I</hi> knew well the lawes of all priſons in <hi>England,</hi> and 15. <abbr>s.</abbr> a week was a great deale of money for beare Lodging; but in regard it was with me, as it was, conditionally that he for his part would uſe me, and thoſe my friends that ſhould come to ſee mee, with civilitie and humanity, <hi>I</hi> would give him 15. <abbr>s.</abbr> a week, and find my own lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen beſides, proteſting unto him, that the firſt time he uſed me, or any that came to ſee me, churliſhly, <hi>I</hi> would not pay him one peny more of money; and <hi>I</hi> muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly confeſſ, <hi>I</hi> have no cauſe in the leaſt to complaine of the man in point of civility, nor he of me in performing my promiſe: for <hi>I</hi> have paid him, though it hath been with ſome ſtraights to me, betwixt 20. and 30. <abbr>l.</abbr> which <hi>I</hi> am now able no longer to pay.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>I</hi> deſire you, according to your duty which by law you are bound unto, to provide me a priſon lodging gratis: for <hi>I</hi> profeſſe unto you, no more rent <hi>I</hi> can, nor will pay, though it coſt me a dungeon (or as bad) for my pains. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Sir, <hi>I</hi> ſhall deale ingeniouſly with you, and give you the true reaſon wherefore <hi>I</hi> condeſcended to pay chamber rent at firſt, and have done it ſo long; it was becauſe <hi>I</hi> had extraordinary potent adverſaries to deale withall, <hi>viz.</hi> the Houſe of Lords, or Peeres, as they are called, who had pretty well managed their dealings with like ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, in keeping very ſtrictly my friends from me, and alſo pen, ink, and paper, that ſo <hi>I</hi> was debarred of all ability in the world, to publiſh to the view of the whole Kingdome, my own innocency, and their inhumane and barbarous tyranny, which they knew well enough I would doe, if I had not been debarred of all meanes to doe it, and then fell upon me, and tranſcendently ſentenced me to pay 4000. <abbr>l.</abbr> &amp;c.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:153457:7"/>and illegally and unjuſtly entered notorious crimes againſt me in their records. And you know I told you at my firſt comming to the Tower, I was refreſhed at the hopes of my being freed from my cloſe impriſonment; but your falling ſo heavily upon me as you did, ſtruck me to the heart, and made me beleeve it was poſſible I might have been deſtroyed before I ſhould have an oppertunity publickly to cleare my own unſpotted innocency in reference to the Lords, and to anotamize their tyranny; both of which my ſoul thirſted after, and therefore if I had been able, I would have purchaſed an oppertunity to have done it, through it had coſt me 20. <abbr>l.</abbr> a week.

And that at preſent <hi>I</hi> have to put him to anſwer, ſhall be certain Arguments which I made when I was cloſe priſoner in irons in the Fleet, againſt the then Epiſcopall Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which will ſerve in every particular, againſt the preſent Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall Miniſters, and you ſhall find them thus laid downe in the 23. page of my Book called, <hi>An Anſwer, of</hi> 9. <hi>Arguments written by</hi> T.B. <hi>and printed at London,</hi> 1645.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That every lawfull Paſtor, Biſhop, Miniſter, or Officer in the viſible Church of Chriſt, ought to have a lawfull call, and be lawfully choſen into his Office, before be can be a true Officer in the Church of Chriſt,</hi> Acts 1.23, 24, 25. and 6.3.5, 6. and 14.23. Gal. 1.1. Heb. 5.4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Miniſters and Officers in the Church of England,</hi> (as well Presbyterian as Epiſcopall) <hi>have not a lawfull call, neither are lawfully choſen to be officers in the Church of Chriſt</hi> See the booke of Ordination of <hi>Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons,</hi> as alſo the Directory, and compare them with the Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore all your Miniſters are falſe and Antichriſtian Officers,</hi> Rev. 9.3. and 13.2. and 16.13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, the doing of thoſe actions that belong to the execution of an Officer, doth not prove a man to be a lawfull Officer, but a lawfull power inſtating him into his Office,</hi> Acts 8.4. and 11.19, 20. and 28.24.25, 26. 1 Cor. 14.29, 30, 31. 1 Pet. 4.10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But all the Miniſters in the Church of England have nothing to prove the Lawfullneſſe of their ſtanding in the Miniſtry, but the actions of a Miniſter, and are not in the leaſt able to prove that they are inſtated in the Miniſtry by vertue of a lawfull power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore they are no true Miniſters of Chriſt, but falſe and Antichriſtian Miniſters of Antichriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, againe in the third place upon your owne grounds, I frame this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thoſe that by their Miniſtry doe not accompliſh the ſame ends, that the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles did, are no true Miniſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Miniſters of the Church of England, doe not accompliſh the ſame ends by their Miniſtry that the Miniſtery of the Apoſtles did,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore your Miniſters are no true Miniſters of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> But <hi>Gangraena</hi> one word more at preſent-to-you, ſeeing in the 271, 281. p. of your late 3 <abbr>d.</abbr>

            </p>
            <p>Jn the ſecond place, becauſe ſo farre as J am able to underſtand your meaning in your fore mentioned pages, you would have me dealt withall, as the <hi>Earle of Strafford,</hi> and the <hi>Biſhop of Canterbury</hi> was, <q>for indeavouring (as you ſay) with ſo much violence, the overthrow of the three Eſtates, and the Lawes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and in the ſtead of the fundamentall Government and conſtitution of this Kingdome, to ſet up an Utopian Anarchy of the promiſcuous multitude and the luſts and uncertain fancies of weake people, for Lawes and Rules.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now in regard of the diſtractions of the Kingdome which are many, and that they might not be made wider by new books from either of us, J ſhall be very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for peace and quiet ſake, <hi rend="margQuotes">to joyne with you in a Petition to the Houſe of Commons to appoint a ſelect Committee publickly to examine all things that are amrſſe in your bookes and mine, and to puniſh either, or both, according to Law and Juſtice without partiality,</hi> and J appeale to all rationall men in the world; whether <hi>I</hi> have not offered fayre or no.</p>

            </p>
            <p>See the 3. of E. 1. ch. 6. <hi>And that no Citie Borough, nor Town, nor any man be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merced without reaſonable cauſe, and according to the quantity of his treſpaſſe,</hi> 9.

            <p>For the ſecond thing, which is, Whether or no there be not in the preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Declarations, and in the Aſſemblies exhortation to take the Covenant, and in Mr. <hi>Prynns</hi> Soveraign power of Parliaments, and other Presbyterian books pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly licenced, and others ſold without controll, as much, if not more, ſaid, to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up, or maintain that which <hi>Gangrena</hi> cals <hi>Vtopian Anarchy,</hi> then in any Books what ever publiſhed by thoſe he calls <hi>Sectaries?</hi> And I averre it poſitively, <hi>There is,</hi> and ſhall joyn iſſue with <hi>Gangraena</hi> to prove it in every particular. Therefore let him pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh an exact Catalogue of any of our Poſitions, when he pleaſeth, and I doubt not but to make it evident, that it cannot juſtly by them be counted any vice in us, to tread in their ſteps, eſpecially ſeeing they have accounted them ſo full of piety, truth and honeſty; as they have done.</p>
            <p>Now firſt, for the Parliaments Declarations, read but the Kings anſwers to them, and you ſhall eaſily ſee he layes it as deeply to their charge of <hi>endeavon ring to ſet up Anarchy,</hi> as <hi>Gangraena</hi> doth either to mine or Mr <hi>Overtons;</hi> yea, and inſtances the particulars, and tells them plainly, <hi>The Arguments they uſe againſt him, will very well in time ſerve the people to turn againſt themſelves.</hi>

            <p>And as for Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> Soveraigne power of Parliaments, I never read more of that Doctrine (in any Book in all my life) that <hi>Gangraena</hi> ſo much condemnes in me, &amp;c. then in that very Book, which is licenced by Mr <hi>White,</hi> a member of the Houſe of Commons, and in his dayes as ſtiffe a Presbyterian as <hi>Gangraena</hi> himſelfe.

               <hi>Pryn,</hi> or the Houſe of Commons, not upon my principles, but their own.</p>
            <p>And therefore, I ſay, a Committee of the Houſe of Commons, is not the whole Parliament; no, nor the whole Houſe of Commons it ſelfe, according to their own principles, which is the only clauſe he can fix upon.</p>
            <p>And good Mr. <hi>Gangrena,</hi> is it not as juſt, and as man-like in me, if I be ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by you, when I have no better weapons to cudgell you with, then your own, to take them from you, and knockt your pate, as to make uſe of my owne propper weapons, to cut you ſoundly, or any other man that ſhall aſſault me to the hazzard of my being, and this is juſt my caſe, that you count ſuch a diſgrace untome.</p>
            <p>But ſay you there, <hi>I</hi> have owned their legiſlative power, and their judicative power over commons: Therefore, you draw an inference to condemn me from mine own practice. Alas man! may not I Lawfully ſeeke or receive a good turn from the hands of any man; &amp; yet as lawfully doe my beſt, to refuſe a miſchief from him?</p>
            <p>But ſecondly I anſwer, what though the 4. of May. 1641. I ſtooped to arryall at the Lords Barre, upon an impeachment againſt me, by the King, doth that ever the more juſtifie their Authority, or declare me to be mutable and unſtable? no, not in the leaſt; for you cannot but know the ſaying of that moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Co. 13 11 <hi>'When J was a child, J ſpake as a child, I under ſtood as a child, I thought as a child: but when</hi> I <hi>became a man, I put away childeſh things.</hi> So ſay I to you: five or ſix yeares ago, I knew nothing but the Lords Juriſdiction was as much more above the Houſe of commons (over Commons) as their Robes and Grandeur in which they ſat was above them; eſpecially ſeeing at all conferences betwix both Houſes I ſec the members of the houſe of commons ſtand bare before the Lords: for which action I now ſee no ground for; eſpecially having of late read ſo many bookes which diſcourſeth upon the Lords juriſdiction, which was upon this ground about a moneth or ſix weeks before the Lords caſt me in priſon.</p>
            <p>A Gentleman, a Member of the houſe of Commons, and one that <hi>I</hi> believe, which wiſheth me well, bid me look to my ſelfe, for to his knowledg, there was a deſigne amongſt ſome of the Lords (the grounds of reaſons of which, he then told me) to clap me by the heeles, and to fall ſo heavie upon me, as to cruſh me in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or elſe make me at leaſt an example, to terriſie others, that they ſhould not dare to ſtand for their Rights.</p>
            <p>And being thus fore-warned, I was halfe a med, which made me diſcours upon every opportunity with any that I though knew any thing of the Lords Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and I found by a generall concurence, that the 29. Ch. of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:153457:12"/>againſt the Lords juriſdiction over Commoners in all criminall caſes: And upon that ground <hi>I</hi> proteſted againſt them: and then upon further inquiry, <hi>I</hi> found Sir <hi>Edward Cooks</hi> Judgement expreſly againſt them, as is before recited: which book, Mr: <hi>Gangraena, I</hi> muſt tell you, is publiſhed ſince my firſt tryall before the Lords, and was not publikely in being when <hi>I</hi> then ſtooped unto their juriſdiction; and then comming priſoner to the Tower, one of my fellow-priſones very honeſtly told me of the fore-mentioned Record of Sir <hi>Simon de Bereford,</hi> which preſently with all ſpeed under Mr. <hi>Collets</hi> hand <hi>I</hi> got out of the Records office.</p>
            <p>All which juſt and legall authorities and teſtimonies makes me ſo ſtiffe againſt the Lords as I am: and <hi>I</hi> hope <hi>I</hi> ſhall continue to the death againſt them in the thing in queſtion betwixt us, as unmoveable as a brazen Wall; come hanging, come burning, or cutting in pieces, or ſtarving, or the worſt that all their malice and ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerous <hi>Gangraena</hi> Prieſts put together can inflict: for all that <hi>I</hi> principally care for, is to ſee if the thing <hi>I</hi> engage in, be juſt; and if my conſcience upon ſolid and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation, tell me it is, <hi>I</hi> will not by the ſtrength of God, if once <hi>I</hi> be enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in it, either goe through with it or dye in them deſt of it, though there be not one man in the world abſolutely of my mind, to back me in it.</p>
            <p>But laſtly, admit in former times, <hi>I</hi> had been as abſolute a Pleader for the Lords juriſdiction over Commoners, as now <hi>I</hi> am againſt them.</p>
            <p>Yet truly, a man of Mr. <hi>Gangraenes</hi> coat is the unfitteſt man in the Kingdome to reprove mee for it. For his Tribe, <hi>I</hi> meane of Prieſts and Deacons, thoſe littie toes of Antichriſt, now called reformed Presbyters, are ſuch a Weather-cock, unſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled generation of wavering minded men, as the like are not in the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>For their predeceſſors in <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. dayes were firſt for the Pope, &amp; al bis Drudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries, and then for the King and his new Religion, and then 3. in his time retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their vomit againe: and then fourthly in <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. dayes became by his proclamation, godly reformed Proteſtants: and then 5. in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, by the authority of her, and her Parliament (which Parliament <hi>I</hi> doe aver it, and will maintaine, had as true a ground to ſet up compulſive Popery, as this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Parliament hath to ſet up compulſive Presbytery) became for the generality of them bloody and perſecuting Papiſts and then 6. by the authority of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> and her Parliament, who had no power at all, no more then this preſent Parliament to wreſt the Scepter of Chriſt out of his hands, and uſurpedly to aſſume the Legiſlative power of Chriſt, to make Lawes to governe the Conſciences of his people; which they have nothing at all to doe with, He, having made perfect, compleat, and unchangeable, Lawes himſelfe, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 9.6.7. and 33.20, 22. <hi>Act,</hi> 1.3. and 3.22, 23. and 20.26, 27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1.2.1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13.18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.2 3, 6. became againe a Generation of pure and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Proteſtants, and have ſo continued to this preſent Parliament: But now like a company of notorious forſworne men (who will be of any Religion in the world, ſo it carry along with it profit and power) after they have for the generallity of them, taken and ſworn ſix or ſeven Oaths, that the Biſhops were the only true Church-government, and that they would be true to them to the death.</p>
            <p>Yet, have now turned the 7. time. and engaged the Parliament and Kingdome in an impoſſible-to-be-kept oath and Covenant, to root up their ghoſtly Fathers the Biſhops, as Antichriſtian, <hi>from whom as Miniſters they received their life and Being.</hi>

            <p>Yea, and now the 8th. time have turned and falne from that Covenant and Oath, by which they mode all ſwear that took it; not onely to root out Biſheps <hi>but all Officers whatſoever that dependeth upon them.</hi> In the number of which, are all the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>lves, having no other ordination to their Miniſtery, but what they had from them, and ſo are properly, really, and truly <hi>dependents upon them;</hi> and yet now of late have by themſelves and inſtruments, as it were forced the Houſe of Commons to paſſe a vote, to declare themſelves all forſworn, that had a finger in that vote, and ſo a people not fit to be truſted, For, by their late vote, <hi>no man what ever must preach and declare Jeſus Chriſt, but be that is Ordained,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>unleſſe they be depending on the Biſhops by Ordination</hi> or elſe on the Presbyters; <hi>who are no Presbyters, unleſſe they depend on the Biſpops for their Ordination:</hi> for they have no other: and what is this elſe, but to puniſh every one that ſhall truly endeavour the true and reall performance of the Covenant? Truly, we have lived to a fine forſworn age, <hi>that men muſt be puniſhed, and made uncapable to be are any office in the Kingdome, if they will not take the Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then if they doe take it, it ſhall be as bad, it they will not forſweare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves every moment of time, that the aſſembly ſhall judge it convenient, and the houſe of Commons vote it.</p>
            <p>And truly, there is in my judgment a good ſtalking horſe for this practice in the Aſſembly of Dry-vines (<hi>alias</hi> Divines, Deut 32.32.33. Eſa 44.25) <hi>Ehortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to take the Covenant</hi> in theſe words, <hi>and if yet there ſhould any oath be found, into which any Miniſters or others have entred, not warranted by the Lawes of God, and the Land, in this caſe, they muſt teach themſelves and others, that ſuch Oathes call for repentance, not partinary in them;</hi> that is to ſay, that neither the Covenant, nor any other Oath whatſoever, that they have before, or hereafter ſhall take, binds them any longer then the time that they pleaſe to ſay it is not warrantable by the Lawes of God, and the Land, and ſo by this Synodian Doctrine, a man may take a hundred Oathes in a day, and not be bound by any of them, if he pleaſe,</p>
            <p>Beſides, <hi>I</hi> would faine know, if by the Parliaments ſo eager preſſing of the Covenant, they doe not preſſe the haſtning of many of their owne deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: For by the Covenant every man that takes it, is bound thereby to maintaine and preſerve the Fundamentall lawes of the Kingdome, which is every day trodden under foot, by ſome of the members of both Houſes arbitray practices, not only tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards Cavaliers, (for which they have ſome colour by pleading neceſſity) but alſo towards thoſe of their owne party, that have as freely and uprightly adventured their lives to preſerve the lawes and liberties of the Kingdome, as any of themſelves: for juſtice and right effectually they have ſcarce done to any man that is a ſuiter to them. And therefore I here challenge all the Members of both Houſes, from the firſt day of their ſitting to this preſent houre, to inſtance me, that man in <hi>England,</hi> that is none of themſelves, nor dependance upon themſelves, that they have done effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all juſtice to, though they have had thouſands of Petitioners and Complainants for grand grievances before the Parliament; ſome of which have, to my knowledge, even ſpent themſelves with proſecuting their buſineſſe before them, and run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves many hundred pounds thick into debt to manage their buſineſſe before them, and yet to this houre not one peny the better; and yet they can find time enough

            <p>But if they will not yeeld that <hi>I</hi> ſhall have my lodging gratis, and my diet found by them, nor intereſt for my many yeares expected, and long-looked for 2000 <abbr>l.</abbr> that laſt yeare they decreed me; nor the remainder of my juſt arreares, which (yet is divels hundreds of pounds, that <hi>I</hi> faithfully, valiantly, and dearly earned with the loſſe of my blood) to maintain and keep me alive, and my wife and ſmall children.</p>
            <p>Then, as my laſt requeſt, I intreat from you to deſire them to call me out to ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall tryall, and by the law of the Kingdome, (but not their arbitrary wills) either to be Juſtified or condemned. And here under my hand, I profeſſe, <hi>I</hi> crave nor deſire, neither mercy, nor favour at their hands, but bid defiance to all the adverſarie <hi>I</hi> have in <hi>England</hi> both great and ſmall, to doe the worſt their malice can unto me; alwayes provided, I may have a legall tryall, by my Peeres, my Equalls, men of my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; according to the juſt, eſtabliſhed, unrepealed, fundamentall law of the Land, contained in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the <hi>Petition of Right;</hi> And truly, Sir, if upon theſe tearmes they will not call me out, but reſolve to keep me here ſtill, <hi>I</hi> will, by Gods aſſiſtance, before many moneths be expired, give them cauſe (with a witneſſe) to call me out: for here, if <hi>I</hi> can helpe it, I will not be deſtroyed with a languiſhing death, though, it coſt me hewing to peeces, as ſmall as fleſh to the pot. For if it had not been that my report hath lain ſo long dormant in the hand of Col. <hi>Henry Martin the glory of his age amongſt Parliament men: for a lover of his Country;</hi> whoſe credit and reputation I ingeniouſly confeſſe, I ſhould be very loath in the leaſt, (if I could avoid it) to beſpatter.</p>
            <p>But in regard by all the meanes and friends <hi>I</hi> can uſe to him, I cannot get him to make my report; though I deſire nothing at his hands but a bate endeavour of the diſcharge of his duty, to quit himſelfe of it, let the iſſue be good or bad, all is one to me, ſo it were but done, or endevoured to be done: <hi>I had long ſince made a formal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the people,</hi> but in regard of my conſtant hard uſage both from divers Lords and Commons, and their laylors, and other inſtruments, and the many unreſiſtable prickings forward of my own ſpirit, which preſſeth me rather to hazzard the undergoing of <hi>Sampſons</hi> portion, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16.21. then to be forced to degenerate from the principles of Reaſon (the King or chiefe of all creatures) into the habit of a bruit beaſt, and ſo to live a ſlave or vaſſal under any power under the Cope of Heaven, whether Regall, or Parliamentary, or what ever it be.</p>
            <p>And therefore, having now with a long deliberated delibertation, committed my wife and children to the tuition, care and protection of a powerfull God, whom for above theſe ten yeares, <hi>I</hi> have feelingly, and ſenſibly known as my God in Jeſus Chriſt; who with a mighty protection, and preſervation hath been with me in ſix troubles, and in ſeven, and from the very day of my publique Conteſt with the Biſhops; hath enabled me to carry my life in my hands, and to have it alwaies in a readieneſſe, to lay it downe in a quarter of an hours warning, knowing that he hath in ſtore for me a manſion of eternall glory.</p>
            <p>All theſe things conſidered, <hi>I</hi> am now determined, by the ſtrenght of God, if I ſpeedily have not that Juſtice, which the Law of <hi>England</hi> affords me, which is all <hi>I</hi> crave, or ſtand in need of, no longer to waît upon the deſtructive ſeaſons of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiall men: but forthwith to make a for mall Appeale to all the Commons of the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and ſet my credit upon the tenters
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:153457:14"/>to get money to print 20000. of them, and ſend them <hi>gratis</hi> to all the Counties thereof: the ingredients of which ſhall be filled with the Parliaments owne Declarations and Arguments againſt the King, turned upon themſelves, and their preſent practiſe, and with a little narrative of my Star-chamber tyrannicall ſufferings; and thoſe I have there to complain of, are firſt Dr. <hi>Lamb, Guin,</hi> and <hi>Aliot,</hi> for committing me. And 2. <hi>Lord Keeper Coventry, Lord Privie. Seal Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> (that corrupteſt of men, whoſe unworthy Son is now, &amp; hath been for ſome yeares, <hi>the chiefe Proſecut or of my ruine, for no other cauſe, but that I have been honeſt, valiant, and faithfull in diſcharging the truſt repoſed in me, which he himſelfe was not (my Lord Newburgh, old Sir Henry Vane</hi> (<hi>a man as full of guilt, as any is in</hi> England, <hi>whoſe baſeneſſe and unworthineſſe I ſhall anotamize to the purpoſe</hi>) <hi>the Lord chiefe Iuſtice Bramſtone,</hi> and <hi>Judge Jones,</hi> who ſentenced me to the Pillory, and to be whipt, &amp;c. And then 3. <hi>Canterbury, Coventry, Mancheſter, Biſh. of London, E. of Arundel, E. of Salithury, L Cottington L. Newbnrgh, Secretary Cook, and Windebank,</hi> who ſentenced me to lye in irons, and to be ſtarved in the priſon of the Fleet; With a ſhort Narrative of my uſage by Lords and Commons this preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and conclude with a Declaration of what is the end, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Parliaments by law ought and ſhould be called, which is to redreſſe miſchiefes and grievances, &amp;c. but not to increaſe them, 4. <hi>E.</hi> 3.14. &amp; 36. <hi>E.</hi> 3.10. <hi>to provide for the peoples weal, but not for their woe, Book Declar.</hi> 1. <hi>part, pag.</hi> 150. and yet notwith ſtanding all the truſt repoſed in them, and all the Proteſtations they have in publique Declarations, made, faithfully, without any private aimes or ends of their owne to diſcharge it: And notwithſtanding all the bloud and money, that hath been ſhed, and ſpent at their beck and and commands. I would faine have any of them to inſtance me any one Act or Ordinance, ſince the wars begun, that they have done or made, that is for the univerſall good of the Commons of <hi>England who have born the bu then of the day.</hi> Sure I am, they have made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Ordinances to eſtabliſh Monopolies againſt the Fundamentall Lawes of the Kingdome, and thereby have robbed free men of their trades and livell hoods, that at their command have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad a fighting for maintaining the Law; and in practiſe, annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the <hi>Petition of Right:</hi> So that a man (though
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:153457:15"/>of their own Party) may ſuffer much if commited by a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-man, or Parliament men, before he can get the Iudges to grant an <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> to bring him and his cauſe up to their Bar there to receive a tryall <hi>(ſecùndum legem terrae)</hi> that is according to the Law of the Land, although the Iudges be ſworn by their oathes to doe it.</p>
            <p>So Sir, deſiring you ſeriouſly to conſider of the premiſes, which I could not conveniently ſend you, but in print, I reſt.</p>
